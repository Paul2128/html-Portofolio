    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>Hello,<br/>My name is Paul and I am 21 years old. I am currently a student at 
      University of Medicine, Pharmacy and Technical Sciences in Târgu Mureș, specialising in machine building technology.
      In the last part of this year I had a motorcycle accident and fractured my collarbone and since then I have not been going to college. While I was at home I was thinking more about myself , my life , and the direction I was going .
      I realized that the life of an engineer is not for me , that's not what I want to do all my life , so I started thinking about what I would like to do , what does life really look like ? And now here I am, trying life, doing this course.</p>
